Modern Times is a satirical, text-based online multiplayer adventure and role-playing game set in modern-day London.

It is also an exercise in collaborative game-design. In fact, everybody is invited to contribute! Check out http://moderntimes.github.com/ModernTimes/contribute.html for more details on how to get involved.

The current goal is to release a minimalistic public preview of the game to attract more contributors.
